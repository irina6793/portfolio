          <p>
            I come from a non-traditional background in which I was introduced
            to technology by going to a networking event when I was completing
            my AmeriCorp service. That event led me to wanting to learn how to
            create apps that would make a difference. I decided to do
            freecodecamp and Codecademy. However, I felt that was not enough and
            decided to enroll into a remote online coding bootcamp. I have built
            projects with React and Node.js.
